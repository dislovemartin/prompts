# SolnAI Prompt Engineering Guide

## üìã Project Overview

This document serves as the master guide for the SolnAI Next.js implementation prompt engineering project. As a prompt engineer, you're responsible for creating effective prompts that guide AI assistants in building a full-featured Next.js application.

## üéØ Prompt Engineering Goals

- Create clear, structured prompts that yield consistent results
- Develop modular prompt components that can be combined flexibly
- Design prompt sequences that follow a logical implementation order
- Balance detail and brevity for optimal AI comprehension
- Include appropriate examples and constraints for guided implementation

## üìÇ Prompt Structure

Our prompt engineering system is organized into three main categories:

### 1. Setup (`/prompt-engineering/setup/`)
- Foundation documents explaining the project structure
- Configuration files for development environments
- Baseline requirements and technology specifications
- Project architecture diagrams and explanations

### 2. Modules (`/prompt-engineering/modules/`)
- Reusable prompt components for specific functionality
- UI component design specifications
- Authentication flow definitions
- API integration patterns
- State management approaches

### 3. Implementation (`/prompt-engineering/implementation/`)
- Sequential implementation guides (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Step-by-step development instructions
- Testing and validation protocols
- Deployment and optimization guidance

## üöÄ Implementation Sequence

For optimal results, implementation prompts should follow this sequence:

1. **Project Setup and Configuration**
   - Environment setup
   - Directory structure creation
   - Base component implementation
   - Styling foundations

2. **Routing and Page Structure**
   - App router configuration
   - Layout hierarchy
   - Route definitions
   - Navigation components

3. **Authentication and User Management**
   - Auth provider integration
   - Protected routes
   - User profile management
   - Session handling

4. **Feature Implementation**
   - Core functionality
   - API integration
   - State management
   - Error handling

5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Final validation

## üìä Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Structure and Organization
- Use clear hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Include numbered lists for sequential steps
- Group related instructions in logical sections
- Use code blocks with language specification

### Language and Clarity
- Prefer specific directives over ambiguous suggestions
- Define technical terms when introducing them
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout
- Use active voice for instructions

### Examples and Context
- Provide sample code snippets for complex implementations
- Include "before and after" examples when applicable
- Demonstrate edge cases and error handling
- Show proper implementation patterns

### Constraints and Requirements
- Clearly mark mandatory vs. optional requirements
- Define success criteria for each implementation phase
- Include version constraints for dependencies
- Specify compatibility requirements

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement Process

1. Create baseline prompts
2. Test with various AI models
3. Analyze output quality and consistency
4. Identify failure patterns
5. Refine prompts to address issues
6. Document improvements
7. Repeat testing cycle

## üìù Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all prompt files
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Add version numbers and last updated dates
- Include references to external resources
- Document prompt dependencies and relationships
