- **error-handling-standards.mdc**: Detailed patterns for effective error handling

## How to Use These Rules

### For Developers


1. **Read and follow these guidelines** when developing components and features
1. **Reference specific sections** during code reviews
2. **Suggest improvements** by creating pull requests to update these guidelines

### For AI Assistants

AI assistants can reference these rules during the development process to ensure adherence to project standards and best practices.

Key areas covered in these guidelines include:


- Code organization and structure
- Naming conventions
