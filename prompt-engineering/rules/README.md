# SolnAI Development Rules

## Overview

This directory contains development rules and guidelines for the SolnAI project. These rules are designed to be referenced by AI assistants during development to ensure consistency, quality, and best practices.

## Available Rules

- **development-guidelines.mdc**: Comprehensive development standards and workflows

## How to Use These Rules

### For Developers

1. **Read and follow these guidelines** when developing components and features
2. **Reference specific sections** during code reviews
3. **Suggest improvements** by creating pull requests to update these guidelines

### For AI Assistants

AI assistants can reference these rules using the `fetch_rules` tool. For example:

```
fetch_rules(["development-guidelines"])
```

This will provide the AI assistant with the complete guidelines for reference during the development process.

## Rule Maintenance

These rules should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect current best practices and lessons learned. When updating rules:

1. Maintain clear section headings for easy reference
2. Include specific examples to illustrate guidelines
3. Keep code examples up-to-date with the current tech stack
4. Document any controversial decisions or trade-offs

## Contributing

To suggest changes to these rules:

1. Create a feature branch (`feature/update-guidelines`)
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the proposed changes
4. Obtain approval from at least one senior team member
