# SolnAI Development Workflow: Feature Implementation Guide

## üìã Task Overview

This guide provides a structured workflow for implementing new features in the SolnAI Next.js application. Following this workflow ensures consistent, high-quality development that aligns with project standards and best practices.

**Purpose:** This workflow serves as the starting point for any development task, providing a detailed sequence of steps from initial planning through implementation, testing, and deployment.

## üéØ Development Process Overview

The SolnAI development process follows a structured workflow divided into logical phases:

1. **Initial Analysis** - Understanding requirements and planning implementation
2. **Environment Setup** - Preparing your development environment
3. **Core Implementation** - Building the feature with a focus on quality
4. **Testing & Validation** - Ensuring correctness and quality
5. **Documentation & Review** - Preparing for integration
6. **Deployment & Monitoring** - Going live and tracking performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Day 1)

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Review feature specification in detail
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Document edge cases and error scenarios
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements with stakeholders

2. **Analyze Technical Feasibility**
   - Evaluate implementation approaches
   - Identify potential technical challenges
   - Consider architecture implications
   - Determine necessary dependencies

3. **Plan Implementation Approach**
   - Break down the feature into logical components
   - Determine data structures and interfaces
   - Plan state management approach
   - Create a component hierarchy diagram

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (Day 1)

4. **Set Up Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Clone repository if needed
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/solnai.git
   cd solnai
   
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install
   
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Verify Environment Configuration**
   - Confirm Next.js version (^14.1.0)
   - Verify TypeScript compiler settings
   - Test development server

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   - Confirm ESLint and Prettier are working

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

### Phase 3: Core Implementation (Days 2-4)

6. **Create Directory Structure**

   ```
   app/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features/
   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature-name]/
   ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
   ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [ComponentName].tsx
   ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [ComponentName].test.tsx
   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts
   ```

7. **Define Types and Interfaces**

   ```tsx
   // types.ts
   export interface ComponentProps {
     // Define component props
   }
   
   export interface ComponentState {
     // Define component state
   }
   
   export type ComponentAction = 
     | { type: 'ACTION_TYPE_1'; payload: PayloadType1 }
     | { type: 'ACTION_TYPE_2'; payload: PayloadType2 };
   ```

8. **Implement Component Skeleton**

   ```tsx
   'use client';
   
   import React from 'react';
   import { ComponentProps } from './types';
   
   export function FeatureComponent({ 
     // destructure props
   }: ComponentProps) {
     // State initialization
     
     // Event handlers
     
     // Effects
     
     // Render logic
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Component structure */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

9. **Implement Core Functionality**
   - Begin with core business logic
   - Focus on correctness first, optimization later
   - Apply consistent error handling patterns
   - Implement proper state management

10. **Add UI Implementation**

- Implement UI following design specifications
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Ensure responsive design
- Implement proper accessibility attributes
- Support dark mode

11. **Integrate with API/Data Layer**

- Implement data fetching with TanStack Query
- Add proper loading states
- Implement error handling for API failures
- Add data validation with Zod

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Day 5)

12. **Write Unit Tests**

   ```tsx
   import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
   import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
   import { FeatureComponent } from './FeatureComponent';
   
   describe('FeatureComponent', () => {
     it('renders correctly with default props', () => {
       render(<FeatureComponent />);
       expect(screen.getByTestId('feature-component')).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
     
     it('handles user interaction correctly', async () => {
       const user = userEvent.setup();
       render(<FeatureComponent />);
       
       await user.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
       await waitFor(() => {
         expect(screen.getByText('Success')).toBeInTheDocument();
       });
     });
   });
   ```

13. **Run ESLint and Type Checking**
