# SolnAI Prompt Validation System

## üìã Overview

The SolnAI Prompt Validation System provides tools and frameworks for validating prompt engineering components and implementation guides. This system helps ensure high-quality, consistent prompts that generate reliable implementations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Validation Tools

### 1. Prompt Validator Script

The `prompt-validator.js` script automatically analyzes prompt implementation guides against predefined criteria and generates validation reports.

#### Installation

The validator requires Node.js and a few dependencies:

```bash
# Navigate to the tools directory
cd prompt-engineering/tools

# Install dependencies
npm install -g glob
```

#### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
node prompt-validator.js "../implementation/*.md"

# Specify output directory
node prompt-validator.js "../implementation/*.md" "../validation/reports"
```

#### Validation Criteria

The validator evaluates prompts against these criteria categories:

1. **Structure Validation**
   - Presence of key sections (overview, requirements, steps, etc.)
   - Reference to core definitions
   - Structural organization

2. **Technical Validation**
   - Code block presence and quality
   - Component imports
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - React hooks usage

3. **Implementation Validation**
   - Checklist items for verification
   - Error handling section
   - Usage examples

4. **AI Compatibility**
   - Content length appropriate for context windows
   - Instructions clarity
   - Proper reference utilization

### 2. Reference Resolver

The `reference-resolver.js` script expands references to core definitions in implementation guides.

```bash
# Basic usage
node reference-resolver.js "../implementation/*.md"
```

## üìä Validation Workflow

### 1. Create Implementation Guide

Use the template at `prompt-engineering/templates/implementation-guide-template.md` as a starting point for new implementation guides.

### 2. Resolve References

Process the implementation guide to expand references:

```bash
node prompt-engineering/tools/reference-resolver.js "path/to/your-guide.md"
```

### 3. Validate the Guide

Run the validator to analyze the guide against quality criteria:

```bash
node prompt-engineering/tools/prompt-validator.js "path/to/your-guide.md"
```

### 4. Review Validation Report

Check the generated validation report in the `validation/reports` directory (or your specified output directory).

### 5. Improve Guide Based on Feedback

Make necessary improvements to address any issues identified in the validation report.

### 6. Re-validate

Re-run the validator to confirm improvements:

```bash
node prompt-engineering/tools/prompt-validator.js "path/to/your-guide.md"
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Use this manual checklist as a supplementary verification method:

### Structure Validation

- [ ] Clear title and overview
- [ ] Technology requirements specified
- [ ] Component specifications detailed
- [ ] Implementation steps provided
- [ ] Validation criteria included

### Technical Validation

- [ ] Code examples are complete and correct
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Component architecture follows best practices
- [ ] Imports and dependencies are properly specified

### Implementation Validation

- [ ] Clear success criteria defined
- [ ] Error handling scenarios covered

- [ ] References are properly formatted
- [ ] No conflicting or redundant information

## üìà Validation Scoring

The validator assigns scores based on weighted criteria:

- **90-100%**: Approved for production
- **75-89%**: Approved with minor revisions
- **50-74%**: Requires significant revision
- **0-49%**: Rejected

## üìä System Improvements Summary

The SUMMARY.md file in this directory provides an overview of recent improvements to the prompt engineering system, including:

1. Enhanced modular reference system
2. Comprehensive validation framework
3. Expanded quality standards
4. Improved implementation templates
5. New development tools

Refer to the [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md) file for detailed information on these improvements.

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The validation system itself should be continuously improved:

1. Update validation criteria based on prompt effectiveness
2. Add new validation rules as patterns emerge
3. Refine scoring weights to prioritize critical factors
4. Integrate feedback from implementation results
