# SolnAI Prompt Engineering Reference System

## üìã Overview

The SolnAI Prompt Engineering Reference System provides a modular approach to creating and maintaining prompt components. It allows you to define core components in a central location and reference them across multiple implementation guides, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

## üîç Key Features


- **Central Definitions Repository**: All core components defined in a single location
- **Reference Syntax**: Simple syntax for referencing components across guides
- **Automatic Resolution**: Tools for expanding references into full content
- **Versioned Components**: Support for tracking component versions
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate content across prompts

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Core Definitions

Core definitions are stored in `prompt-engineering/core/definitions.md` using this format:

```markdown
<!-- SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->

# Component Title

Component content goes here.
It can include multiple paragraphs,
code blocks, etc.

```tsx
// Even code blocks work
function example() {
  return "Hello, world!";
}

```text
<!-- /SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->

````text

### 2. Reference Componentss

When creating implementation guides, reference components using this syntax:

```markdow

# Implementation Guidedee

## Technology Stack

Reference: [SOLNAI:TECH-STACK]

## Other Section

Regular content continues here..

``````t
### 3. Resolve Referencescesess

Use the reference resolver tool to generate complete guides:

`
# Install dependencies first
st
rst
irst
npm install -g # Run the resolver
solver
node prompt-engineering/tools/reference-resolver.js "prompt-engineering/implementation/*.
`````````text
This will create new files with `-resolved` suffix that contain the fully expanded content.

## üìù Available Components

| Reference Key | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `TECH-STACK` | Core technology stack and versions |
| `DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE` | Standard project directory structure |
| `PROJECT-INIT` | Project initialization commands |
| `QUALITY-STANDARDS` | Code quality and implementation standards |
| `BUTTON-COMPONENT` | Button component implementation |
| `AUTH-SETUP` | Authentication setup and configuration |

## üöÄ Creating New Components

To add a new component to the definitions file:


1. Decide on a clear, descriptive key in UPPER-KEBAB-CASE
1. Add your component to `definitions.md` using the standardized format
2. Include all necessary details, code snippets, and explanations
3. Document the new component in this README

## üîÑ Updating Existing Components

When updating an existing component:


1. Modify the component content in `definitions.md`
1. Update the version metadata if applicable
2. Regenerate any affected implementation guides
3. Document significant changes

## üîç Best Practices

1. **Atomic Components**: Keep components focused on a single concern
1. **Complete Context**: Ensure components provide all necessary context
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent Markdown formatting
3. **Clear References**: Use descriptive reference keys
4. **Appropriate Granularity**: Don't make components too large or too small

## üìä Benefits of this Approach


1. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent implementation across different guides
1. **Maintainability**: Update components in one place, reflected everywhere
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between core components and implementation guides
3. **Modularity**: Compose complex guides from simpler, reusable components
4. **Versioning**: Track changes to components over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If references aren't resolving correctly:


1. Check that the reference key exactly matches the definition key
1. Verify that the reference syntax is correct: `[SOLNAI:KEY-NAME]`
2. Ensure the definitions file is properly formatted with correct opening and closing tags
3. Check for any error messages from the reference resolver script

This reference system will significantly improve the maintainability and consistency of the SolnAI prompt engineering system. By centralizing core components and providing a clear mechanism for referencing them, we can reduce redundancy and ensure that updates are reflected across all implementation guides.
