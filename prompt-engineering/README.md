## 🛠️ Working with the Modular Reference System

### Adding New Components

To add a new reusable component:



1. Add the component to `core/definitions.md` using the format:

   ```markdown
   <!-- SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->
   # Component Title

   Component content here
   <!-- /SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->
   ```text



1. Reference the component in implementation guides:

   ```markdown
   Reference: [SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME]
   ```text

### Resolving Referencess

Use the reference resolver to expand references:

```bash
node tools/reference-resolver.js "implementation/*.md"

````tex

### Validating Promptstss
