- **Directory Structure**: Outlines the recommended project organization and file naming conventions.

### 2. Explore Core Definitions

The core directory contains modular components that can be referenced across implementation guides:

- **Core Definitions**: Central repository of reusable prompt components.

### 3. Explore Modular Components

The modules directory contains reusable prompt components focused on specific functionality areas:

- **UI Components**: Defines the design system and implementation patterns for UI elements.
- **Authentication**: Provides patterns for implementing secure user authentication.
- **State Management**: Offers strategies for managing application state.
- **API Integration**: Details approaches for connecting to backend services.
- **Accessibility Guide**: Ensures implementation follows accessibility best practices.
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Provides solutions for common implementation issues.

### 4. Follow Development Rules

The rules directory contains guidelines and standards for development:

- **Development Guidelines**: Comprehensive standards for code quality and organization.
- **Error Handling Standards**: Detailed patterns for effective error handling.

### 5. Follow the Implementation Sequence

The implementation guides provide step-by-step instructions for building the application:

1. **Project Setup**: Initialize the project and establish the foundation.
2. **Routing and Pages**: Implement the application's page structure and navigation.
3. **Authentication Flow**: Add user authentication and protected routes.

### 6. Validate Your Prompts

Use the validation tools to ensure your prompts meet quality standards:

1. **Create Guides**: Use the templates in the `templates` directory to create new guides.
2. **Resolve References**: Use the reference resolver to expand references in your guides.
3. **Validate Guides**: Run the prompt validator to analyze your guides against quality criteria.
4. **Review Reports**: Check the validation reports in the `validation/reports` directory.
5. **Improve Guides**: Make improvements based on validation feedback.

## 🛠️ Working with the Modular Reference System

### Adding New Components

To add a new reusable component:

1. Add the component to `core/definitions.md` using the format:

   ```markdown
   <!-- SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->
   # Component Title
   
   Component content here
   <!-- /SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME -->
   ```

2. Reference the component in implementation guides:

   ```markdown
   Reference: [SOLNAI:COMPONENT-NAME]
   ```

### Resolving References

Use the reference resolver to expand references:

```bash
node tools/reference-resolver.js "implementation/*.md"
```

### Validating Prompts

Use the prompt validator to analyze quality:

```bash
node tools/prompt-validator.js "implementation/*.md"
```
