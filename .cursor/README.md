# SolnAI Development Rules

## Overview

This directory contains development rules and guidelines for the SolnAI project. These rules are designed to be referenced by AI assistants during development to ensure consistency, quality, and best practices.

## Available Rules



- **development-guidelines.mdc**: Comprehensive development standards and workflows

## How to Use These Rules

### For Developers


1. **Read and follow these guidelines** when developing components and features
1. **Reference specific sections** during code reviews
2. **Suggest improvements** by creating pull requests to update these guidelines

### For AI Assistants

AI assistants can reference these rules using the `fetch_rules` tool. For example:

```text
fetch_rules(["development-guidelines"])

```text
This will provide the AI assistant with the complete guidelines for reference during the development process.
