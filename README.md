# SolnAI Next.js Implementation Project

This repository contains a comprehensive set of prompt engineering tools for implementing the SolnAI Next.js application, structured for maximum clarity and usability.

## 📁 Getting Started

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1. Review the `prompt.md` file in the root directory
2. This file contains the complete project initialization guide
3. Follow the structured approach outlined in the guide to set up your SolnAI Next.js application

The prompt.md file provides detailed instructions for setting up the directory structure, installing dependencies, and configuring essential components.

The implementation guides are located in the `prompt-engineering` directory. Start by exploring:



- [**Prompt Engineering System**](prompt-engineering/README.md) - Complete overview of the prompt engineering system



- [**Reference System**](prompt-engineering/README-REFERENCE-SYSTEM.md) - How to use the modular reference system

## 🚀 Implementation Components

The prompt engineering system is organized into specialized components:



- [**Core Definitions**](prompt-engineering/core/definitions.md) - Central repository of reusable prompt components


- [**Development Rules**](prompt-engineering/rules/) - Guidelines and standards for development
- [**Validation Tools**](prompt-engineering/validation/) - Tools for ensuring prompt quality
- [**Implementation Guides**](prompt-engineering/implementation/) - Step-by-step implementation instructions
